A Java library which connects the WaterRower S4/S5 Performance Monitor with Windows, Linux or macOS.

## Usage

The library requires JDK 9 or higher.

The usage of the library is very simple. Just start with the following examples:

### Connect / disconnect

```Java

// Establish a connection:
WaterRower waterRower = new WaterRower();
waterRower.addConnectionListener(...);
waterRower.connect(...);

...

// Disconnect:
waterRower.disconnect();

```

If you don't want to search for the correct port manually, you can use the class ```WaterRowerAutoDiscovery```. The auto-discovery automatically searches for the available ports and tries to connect the WaterRower.
In this case you don't need to connect the WaterRower yourself.

```Java

// Initialize and start the auto-discovery:
WaterRowerAutoDiscovery discovery = new WaterRowerAutoDiscovery(waterRower, Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor());
discovery.start();

...

// Stop the auto-discovery:
discovery.stop();

```

If the connection to the WaterRower gets lost. The auto-discovery tries to reconnect automatically.

Please note, you can use the interface ```IDiscoveryStore``` in order to improve the performance when searching for serial ports.


### Subscribe to values

A simple example:

```Java

// Subscribe to events:
waterRower.subscribe(new StrokeSubscription() {
    public void onStroke(StrokeType strokeType) {
        // ... do your stuff here!
    }
}

...

```

The following value subscriptions are available:

| Subscription | Description |
|---|---|
| ```DisplayedDistanceSubscription``` | A subscription for the *displayed distance* (in meters) on the distance window of the Performance Monitor. The value is set to zero if the Performance Monitor was reset. |
| ```DisplayedDurationSubscription``` | A subscription for the *displayed duration* on the duration window of the Performance Monitor. The duration window displays the time covered (or time to be covered in a duration workout). |
| ```AverageVelocitySubscription``` | A subscription for the *displayed average velocity* (in meters per second) on the intensity window of the Performance Monitor. |
| ```StrokeSubscription``` |  A subscription for *stroke events*. The values will be send immediately by the Performance Monitor and will not be polled by the library. |
| ```StrokeCountSubscription``` | A subscription for the *stroke count* value (number of strokes). |
| ```AverageStrokeRateSubscription``` | A subscription for the *displayed stroke rate* (strokes/min) of a whole stroke which is displayed in the stroke rate window of the Performance Monitor. |
| ```TankVolumeSubscription``` | A subscription for the *tank volume* value (in liters). This is the value the user has set in the Performance Monitor (see manual). |
| ```ClockCountDownSubscription``` | A subscription for *clock count down* values. This value is transmitted if a count down is programmed in the Performance Monitor. |
| ```TotalDistanceSubscription``` | A subscription for the *total distance* values of the Performance Monitor. The value represents the total distance meter counter - this value will be reset to zero when the Performance Monitor is switched off. |
| **Advanced subscriptions:** | | 
| ```PulseCountSubscription``` | A subscription for *pulse count* events. Will be called, when pulse count was updated. The value is representing the number of pulseâ€™s counted during the last 25mS period; this value can range from 1 to 50 typically. (Zero values will not be transmitted). |
| ```TotalVelocitySubscription``` | A subscription for the *total velocity* (in meters per second). |

Don't forget to unsubscribe, if you are no longer interested in a value. For example it makes sense to get the tank volume after the WaterRower was connected. But because it is very unlikely that the value will change during a session, you can unsubscribe this subscription after you got the value once.

The library needs to poll for each value of each subscription synchronously. Thus a high number of subscriptions may lead to performance issues.  

### Configure workouts

Workouts can be a *single* or an *interval workout* (with rest intervals).

```Java

// Send a single workout:
Workout workout = new Workout(2000, METERS);
waterRower.startWorkout(workout);

// Send an interval workout:
Workout workout = new Workout(1000, METERS);
workout.addInterval(30, 2000);
workout.addInterval(30, 2000);
waterRower.startWorkout(workout);

...

```

The unit given in the class `Workout` also determines the units of the intervals.

Overall there are 2 types of workouts based on the unit:

- Duration workout (time)
- Distance workout (distance or strokes)

The workout types or units can not be mixed up in an interval workout.

### Find available serial ports (manually)

```Java

// Get all available serial ports:
SerialPort[] commPorts = SerialPort.getCommPorts();

// Get the name of the ports:
for (SerialPort port : commPorts) {
    String portName = port.getSystemPortName();
}

```

## Compatibility

The following devices were tested:

- WaterRower S4 Performance Monitor (Firmware 2.1)

If you have successfully tested more devices please feel free to add them to issue [#8](https://github.com/tbressler/waterrower-core/issues/8).

Thank you for your support :-)
